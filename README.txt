Asteroids

A game by Nico Orint, Samuel Lewis, Johnathan Macias

TODO: Astroid collision with player and/or bullets.

TODO: Wrap around

TODO: Wrap around with buffer on the sides to hide teleports

TODO: Size Canvas with CSS or Html to avoid frame updates

IDEA: Im thinking of adding a drop-down thing on each page to change the color to light-mode or dark-mode, i can add the dropdown and ids if the person doing javascript can handle the event. - Jonathan
