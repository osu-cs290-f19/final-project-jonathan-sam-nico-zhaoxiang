# Final_Project_Jonathan_Sam_Nico

Added the game files inside the source folder. Should run on any computer but I might have some directory issues I forgot to remove.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: Event listeners lag when two commands are entered at once. ( the game still renders at 60fps during this lag so it is just a 
issue with the event listeners)

TODO: Movement.

TODO: Astroid generation.

TODO: Astroid collision with player and/or bullets.

IDEA: Im thinking of adding a drop-down thing on each page to change the color to light-mode or dark-mode, i can add the dropdown and ids if the person doing javascript can handle the event. - Jonathan
